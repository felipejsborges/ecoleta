<h3>What is Ecoleta?</h3>

Ecoleta is a project that was developed during **Next Level Week**. An online event organized by [Rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br/) that aims to **up the career of developers** by challenging them to build a **complete application**. We built an API, a website and a mobile application. June 5th was also the **international environment day**. So we created a website where entities could register and inform what some **kind of material that can't be disposed in common garbage** that they are collecting, like batteries or cooking oil, for example. We also created an application where the user can access and **check on the map the points registered on the webiste** and locate where have one to discard some item they need.

<h3>What language was used?</h3>

We used [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/home.html), because it provides us a better autocomplete and reduces the chance of errors by comparing with simple JavaScript.

<h3>And the technologies?</h3>

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/) for the API
- [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) for the website
- [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started) and [Expo](https://docs.expo.io/) for the mobile application
