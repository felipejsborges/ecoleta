## Intro
[Back to sumary](#sumary)

Omnistack week is an event to discover **new technologies and tools, learn new concepts and get new skills**. During this intense week, we get access to content **focused on the practice** of technologies that are used by big companies like Facebook, Netflix, Airbnb and many others. Besides having access to an **exclusive community** with Rocketseat instructors and thousands of other developers. The main technologies used in this event:
- Node.js for back-end;
- React.js for front-end;
- React Native for mobile.	

We developed a **website** called **BeTheHero** where an **organization could add incidents** that need financial assistance from society and a **mobile app** where people could access and see a list of the created incidents, select one and **contact the organization**. The default features were made with the Rocketseat instructor. So I decided to put to test the knowledge acquired and create new features. Let's see the entire website and mobile app features.
